## What I Practiced

*Ofcourse the Styled Components and Material UI elements props.
*I have completed the project very relaxed way in 2 Days, I have learned more calm down way of developing thanks to Bestseller. 

## What can I Do for Improving the App

*Depending on the total project structure, i can practice to use Redux on that project.
*I can create a Postgresql Database and use as Database for cardnumber.
*I can try and practice to migrate the project to Next.JS
*In a great environment and with the best people, I think i can't imagine the limits.
